# breaktime-sh

This is a simple bash script inspired by [breaktime](https://github.com/ncthis/breaktime/) for OS X. It forces you to take breaks, by locking your screen after an amount of time.

I rewrote the Node version because it seemed like overkill for something so simple. A comparison will show that the Node and bash code is largely identical.

I cannot pretend that this is good bash; it is probably horrendous bash. I want to learn some more scripting, and you have to start somewhere! PR's graciously received.

```sh
     ./breaktime --help
     ./breaktime 45 minutes
```
